It took quite a bit longer than announced by Amazon, but today it has finally happened: The German version of the paperback can now be ordered by anyone via Amazon.

With this milestone I can now promote the book (and this website). Until it was possible to buy the printed version as well, that didn't make much sense.

With the English translation and further text improvements based on feedback, I still have a lot of plans for this book. But the big project of writing the book, and publishing it in 1st edition, is now complete with the availability of the German paperback.
