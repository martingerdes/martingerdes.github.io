Starting with the upcoming version 1.2 (still only in german), the book will include an image of an example open space that could be set up in a neighborhood in my residential building concept (chapter 9.2):

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/open_space/birds_eye.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

<div class="caption">
Example open space: trees, lawn, stage, sand box, picnic table, 3 park benches (bottom right, top right), circular path, 2 hammocks (top center), viewing points, flower beds (bottom right, center left, top right)
</div>

I cannot include more than this one image in the book without making what is already the most image-rich chapter of the book too bloated.
Instead, a source reference leads to this blog post and thus to the following image gallery, which shows more perspectives of this open space.

Only with these pictures does one get a real idea of how much can be achieved with good landscaping in such an open space. How little it feels like a “high-rise” when you step out of your container apartment:

I have modeled this open space with [SketchUp](https://app.sketchup.com). If you would like to explore this model yourself, you can do so by importing [this model file](/assets/skp/open_space.skp) there.
