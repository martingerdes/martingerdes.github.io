Since the German ebook variant of the book can be bought, I have pushed the website to be live.

The (German language) paperback is still being verified by Amazon, but should be available during the next days as well.

I have used the last days to noticeably improve the freely available HTML version of the book, by using a script to modify the HTML code generated by the conversion tool, and by adjusting the used CSS.

The result of that is a well structured table of content, good indentation of lists and a far better formating of the index.

The English translation of the book is still a few months away. I want to finish the publication process first and gather initial feedback, before I start on the project of translating text and images to English.
